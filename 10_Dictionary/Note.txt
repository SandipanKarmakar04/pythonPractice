items(): This method is used to return a view object that displays a list of key-value pairs as tuples. This is 
         particularly useful when you want to iterate through both keys and values simultaneously.
get(): used to retrieve the value of a specified key in a dictionary. If the key doesnâ€™t exist, it can return a 
       default value instead of raising a KeyError.
popitem(): method removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair from a dictionary. If the dictionary is 
           empty, it raises a KeyError.
clear(): This method is used to delete all the elements from the dictionary.
del: This keyword helps to delete the value from the memory reference.

for key, value in variableName.items():
    print(key, value)

if "value" in variableName:
    print("sample text to print")

variableName["keyName"] = "value"   

square = {x:x**2 for x in range(5)}
