__init__
Self: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access the 
      variables that belongs to the class.
      Inside a class as a member function or instance method is always required a self parameter.

We can not directly create multiple constructor in python but we can define instance methods as per the need.

Static Method: Methods that dont use self parameter (works at class level).'@staticmethod' this decorator is 
               used to define a method static.
